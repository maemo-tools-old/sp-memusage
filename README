MALLINFO USAGE

This application may be used for dumping status for mallinfo() and
sbrk() calls into $HOME/mallinfo-PID.trace file. May be linked
dynamical and statical. Works everywhere.

To enable tracing you have to set MALLINFO variable:
   export MALLINFO="yes"        -- use 5 seconds timeout and SIGALRM
   export MALLINFO="signal=10"  -- use SIGUSR1 to generate the report
   export MALLINFO="period=10"  -- periodic report for 10 secons

The report format is the following:
   time    - time of report since application started
   arena   - size of non-mmapped space allocated from system
   ordblks - number of free chunks
   smblks  - number of fastbin blocks
   hblks   - number of mmapped regions
   hblkhd  - space in mmapped regions
   usmblks -  maximum total allocated space
   fsmblks - space available in freed fastbin blocks
   uordblks - total allocated space
   fordblks - total free space
   keepcost - top-most, releasable (via malloc_trim) space
   total    - mi.uordblks + mi.fordblks + mi.hblkhd,
   sbrk     - sbrk pointer at the specified time
